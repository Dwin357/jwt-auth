So the idea that is bubbling up is to basically have this act as a bunch of middle-wares, w/ the JAuth being the Operation


so, I am having ideas
	- exclude routes  :: things passed through w/out additional action
	- session routes  :: things passed through and listened to for session details
	- everything else :: validate existance of session


working on the operation, I'm having issues but I wonder if this is b/c I'm biting off more than I can chew.

basically the problem is
	- in order to do login, I need DB access to validate user info
	- in order to set sessions, I need to have knowledge of the cookie+signing key

so...  after meditating on it for a bit, the only answer I can come up with is to expose DB access by effectivly making an API.
 -> Not actually true.  The middle-ware can still call into the app and intercept the response.

hmm.  How to do this..?

Also, is this the best problem to be working on right now?

I think the setting of sessions can be done more easily and without the authorization piece just yet.
